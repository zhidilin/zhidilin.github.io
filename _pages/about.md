# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px">

+ Please refer to my new homepage: [https://zhidi-lin.github.io/](https://zhidi-lin.github.io/)

+ This is **Zhidi Lin (ÊûóÂøóÂú∞)**. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Yin](https://blsp-group.github.io/) (main-supervisor) and [Prof. Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (co-supervisor). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received my M.Sc. degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Qi Yang and [Prof. Xuemin Hong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xuemin-Hong). From Aug. 2017 to Mar. 2019, I was a research intern at [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/en) (SRIBD), working with [Prof. Dongliang Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OEDs9p8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Liuqing Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmOGdOYAAAAJ&hl=en). 
+ I am affiliated with the [Bayesian Learning for Signal Processing (BLSP) Group](https://blsp-group.github.io/) of CUHK-Shenzhen, where my research mainly focuses on data-driven modeling, Approximate Bayesian Inference, Gaussian processes, and related applications.

[Output-Dependent Gaussian Process State-Space Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

**Zhidi Lin**, Lei Cheng, Feng Yin, Lexi Xu, Shuguang Cui

[**Project**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10095784) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods.
- We also reduced the computation complexity to $$O(n)$$.
